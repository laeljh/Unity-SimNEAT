# Unity-SimNEAT
A C# neural net model (made for Unity, but compatible with any C# environment) inspired by Googles WANN and NEAT. 
This network connects to any agent, by specifying all the inputs and connects to the outputs. 
It is universal, but I created it with intention to use it my biome simulations with sexual/asexual reproduction (and it works!)
However this is a highly flexible model, not far from state of the art (it was state of the art at the time of making) capable 
of learning any inputs/outputs models and environments. 
THE ONLY MODEL AT THE TIME OF CREATION CAPABLE OF EVOLVING BACKLOOPED NEURON PATHS FOR FORMING MEMORIES AND PROCESSING CHAIN DATA.

If you think this is SimthingNEAT then hit me up. I'm looking for Junior dev jobs.
